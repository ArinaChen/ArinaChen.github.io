        "An EV dataset can be a valuable choice due to its relevance, data availability, and potential research questions. The growing EV market and government policies make it a timely topic. The large size and diversity of EV data allow for comprehensive analysis.\n",

        "<br>\n",
        "2. **What kind of insight do you hope to gain from this database (What we curious)**<br>\n",
        "We plan to exam the number and distribution of different EV brands, models, the trends, and electric range capabilities combining with the produced year, for example: we are curious about if the electric range has positive correlation with the year and the customer acceptance (reflecting by the sales amount).\n",

        "3. **How will your analysis help people? (who are these people )**\n",
        "We can provide valuable insights and prediction for a range of stakeholders. Potential EV buyers, government officials, businesses, environmental advocates, and researchers can benefit from understanding market trends, consumer preferences, policy implications, and environmental impacts.\n",
